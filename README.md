# NYC_Subway_Data_Analysis

The NYC public transportantion system - Metro Transit Authority - provides data for download via csv files. Part of the information available are data from the subway turnstiles, containing weekly logs for cumulative entries and exits by turnstile and by subway station during a provided timeframe.

For this project, I have only used the information available at: http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html.

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between data from the NYC Subway turnstiles and the city weather. For this, besides data from the subway, we will also need data from the weather in NYC.

Here are the main points that will be considered in this work:

- Gathering data from the Internet
- Using Statistics for Data Analysis
- Data handling and simple graphics creation with Pandas
